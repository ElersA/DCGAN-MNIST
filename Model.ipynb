    "# Why DCGAN instead of GAN?\n",
    "\n",
    "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) use two networks to generate data (generator) and classify if it is real or generated (discriminator). These two networks continuously tries to improve their abilities and after training one can supply some noise to the generator and it will generate some output, e.g. a cat if it has been trained on cat pictures.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Problems with GANs are that they are hard to train, the model can collapse, slight changes in variables/architecture can destabilize the model, i.e. training GANs is somewhat of an art according to some. Deep Convolutional GANs (DCGANs) solves/mitigates these problems.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Main differences between DCGANs and GANs\n",
    "Making three changes to GANs allows them to become more stable and produce better results.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The first change is to replace pooling functions with convolution layers.  \n",
    "The second change is to remove fully connected layers on top of convolutional layers.  \n",
    "The third change to use batch normalization (although with some caveats...)\n",

    "## General Architecture of DCGANs\n",
    "The general architecture of a DCGAN is very similar to a GAN, both can even contain deep convolutional layers despite the names. The architecture consists of a generator which generates an image out of some initial noise and a discriminator which classifies real and fake images. The picture below gives an overview of a GAN/DCGAN.\n",

    "### DCGAN loss function\n",
    "Our DCGAN will use two cost functions, one for the generator and one for the discriminator. One can choose among several different cost functions for the the generator, we chose a heuristically motivated cost function which ensures that the \"losing\" network's gradient is strong. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Ex~pdata = Average value that x takes when it is drawn from its distribution\n",
    "- z = Input distribution to generator \n",
    "- G(z) = Output from the generator given z\n",
    "- D(G(z)) = The discriminators classification of G(z), i.e. real or false\n",
